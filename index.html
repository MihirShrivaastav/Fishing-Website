        <strong>Varanasi</strong> known as Banaras is a city situated on the banks of the River Ganges in Uttar Pradesh. Ganga Ghats are main attraction of the holy city Varanasi.
        Ghats of Ganga are perhaps the holiest spots of Varanasi. It has numbers of Ghats more than 100 ghats along side Ganga. The city is considered sacred by
        Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. Most of the ghats are bathing ghats, while others are used as cremation sites. Many ghats are associated with legends or 
        mythologies while many ghats are privately owned. The former Kashi Naresh owns Shivala or Kali ghat. Morning boat ride on the Ganges across the ghats is a
        popular visitor's attraction.

    <p>Aquaculture is relatively new, promising and upcoming sector in the Uttar Pradesh To promote the fishery industry in U.P. the government has been trying
    to focus on some of the issues such as development of technologies and ensuring availability of fingerlings of local species, creation of infrastructural
    framework for aquaculture mitigating institutional and investment constraints, providing incentives in the form of subsidy ranging from 20-50% and mapping
    out suitable sites etc Furthermore, the extreme climatic conditions are a challenge in the region and restricts the economic productivity of inland
    aquaculture systems.</p>

    <p>The Department has started various innovative schemes to support small fish farmers by preparing the facilities of hatcheries, nurseries, feed mills,
    models ponds, integrated demonstration units and mobile outlets for value added products. The new fisheries projects are expected to yield 13 769 lac ton

<h2><strong><u><center>An Overview</center></u></strong></h2><br>
<p class="overview">
  <strong>Fishing</strong> is the activity of trying to catch fish. Fish are often caught in the wild but may also be caught from stocked bodies of water. Techniques
   for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping. "Fishing" may include catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as molluscs,
   crustaceans, and echinoderms (such as starfish and sea urchins). The term is not normally applied to catching farmed fish, or to aquatic mammals, such as whales 
   where the term whaling is more appropriate. In addition to being caught to be eaten, fish are caught as recreational pastimes. Fishing tournaments are held, and caught
    fish are sometimes kept as preserved or living trophies. When bioblitzes occur, fish are typically caught, identified, and then released
